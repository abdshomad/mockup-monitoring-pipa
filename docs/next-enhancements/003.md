### Proactive & Predictive AI (Leveraging Gemini)

1.  **`NE-010` Proactive AI Incident Commander Assistant**
    -   **Idea:** When a high-severity incident is declared, the AI would automatically generate a "Strategy Brief." This would include instant correlation of adjacent sensor data, recent maintenance history, and use Google Search grounding to find relevant external information (e.g., public construction permits, minor seismic events). It would also suggest a best-practice action plan and draft initial communication templates.
    -   **Benefit:** Dramatically reduces cognitive load on operators during high-stress situations, ensures procedural consistency, and shaves critical minutes off initial response times.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
    -   **Priority:** `High`
    -   **Implementation Date:** `N/A`

2.  **`NE-011` AI-Generated Video Briefings for Incidents**
    -   **Idea:** Add a "Generate Video Briefing" button in the "Incident Detail" view. Using the incident's data, the system would call a generative video model (`veo-2.0-generate-001`) to create a concise, 20-30 second animated summary of the event, perfect for escalating to management or for shift handovers.
    -   **Benefit:** Provides an incredibly efficient and impactful way to communicate complex situations to stakeholders who may not have time to read detailed reports.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
    -   **Priority:** `Medium`
    -   **Implementation Date:** `N/A`

3.  **`NE-012` Predictive Asset Lifecycle Management**
    -   **Idea:** Enhance the "Asset Management" view with an AI-powered predictive layer. By analyzing an asset's model, operational environment, and historical data, the AI could predict its Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and estimate a "Predicted Failure Date." This would be used to automatically propose maintenance tasks *before* a failure occurs.
    -   **Benefit:** Shifts maintenance strategy from reactive/scheduled to truly predictive, minimizing costly unplanned downtime and maximizing the useful lifespan of every asset.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
    -   **Priority:** `High`
    -   **Implementation Date:** `N/A`

### Advanced Visualization & Collaboration

4.  **`NE-013` Collaborative Incident Response Map**
    -   **Idea:** When viewing an active incident, the Map View would enter an "Incident Mode." This would enable shared annotations (drawing on the map), live technician GPS tracking, and incident-specific data layers. All annotations would be saved as part of the incident log for post-mortem analysis.
    -   **Benefit:** Creates a true "Common Operational Picture" for everyone involved, from the control room to the field, massively improving situational awareness, coordination, and safety.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
    -   **Priority:** `Medium`
    -   **Implementation Date:** `N/A`
