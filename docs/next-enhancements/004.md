### Enhanced Asset & Network Management

14. **`NE-014` AI-Powered Predictive Battery Management**
    -   **Idea:** Log the battery voltage from each LoRaWAN sensor's uplink. Use this historical data with a simple AI model to learn the discharge curve for each device in its environment and predict the battery's "Estimated End of Life."
    -   **Benefit:** Shifts battery maintenance from reactive to truly predictive. The system can automatically generate a high-priority maintenance task when the predicted life falls below a threshold (e.g., 6 months), preventing data loss from dead sensors.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented (2025-09-07T19:00:00Z)`
    -   **Priority:** `High`

15. **`NE-015` LoRaWAN Network Health Dashboard**
    -   **Idea:** Create a dedicated dashboard under `System Health` to monitor the status of all LoRaWAN gateways. This view would map gateway locations and visualize key network metrics like the number of connected sensors, average signal strength (RSSI), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each gateway.
    -   **Benefit:** Provides network administrators with a clear, real-time view of the communication backbone's health. It allows for the quick diagnosis of coverage gaps, dead zones, and failing gateways before they impact a large number of sensors.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
    -   **Priority:** `Medium`
    -   **Implementation Date:** `N/A`

### Intelligent Data & Remote Device Control

16. **`NE-016` Remote Sensor Configuration via Downlinks**
    -   **Idea:** Implement functionality to queue and send "downlink" commands to remote sensors. For example, an operator could remotely change a sensor's reporting interval from 60 minutes to 5 minutes during an active incident. The UI would manage the asynchronous nature of LoRaWAN by showing command status (`Queued`, `Acknowledged`).
    -   **Benefit:** Enables dynamic, on-demand control over field assets without physical intervention. This allows for more granular data collection during critical events while conserving power during normal operations.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
    -   **Priority:** `Medium`
    -   **Implementation Date:** `N/A`

17. **`NE-017` Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA) Updates**
    -   **Idea:** Develop a module for managing FOTA update campaigns. Administrators could upload new firmware, select a group of sensors, and initiate a managed, low-bandwidth update process. A dashboard would track the progress of the campaign over hours or days.
    -   **Benefit:** Allows for remote deployment of critical security patches and feature updates to thousands of sensors, drastically reducing long-term operational costs and ensuring the entire sensor network remains secure and up-to-date.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
    -   **Priority:** `Low`
    -   **Implementation Date:** `N/A`

### Advanced AI-Powered Operational Insights

18. **`NE-018` AI-Powered Time-Series Anomaly Detection**
    -   **Idea:** Use Gemini to analyze long-term, low-frequency time-series data collected via LoRaWAN. The AI would detect subtle, slow-developing anomalies that fall below immediate alert thresholds, such as a gradual increase in average daily vibration over several months.
    -   **Benefit:** Identifies potential future failures or developing issues like corrosion or geological stress long before they become critical. These insights would be flagged for inclusion in the next scheduled maintenance cycle, enhancing the predictive maintenance program.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented (2025-09-07T10:00:00Z)`
    -   **Priority:** `High`

19. **`NE-019` AI Assistant for LoRaWAN Network Analysis**
    -   **Idea:** Enhance the AI Assistant's context to include gateway status and signal quality data. Operators could then ask natural language questions about the network itself.
    -   **Example Queries:** *"Which sensors are connected to Gateway-03?"*, *"Show all sensors with an SNR below -10dB."*, *"Correlate offline sensor alerts with gateway outages in the last 24 hours."*
    -   **Benefit:** Empowers operators to troubleshoot network issues quickly and intuitively, reducing the reliance on specialized network engineers for first-level diagnostics.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented (2025-09-07T20:00:00Z)`
    -   **Priority:** `Medium`
    -   **Implementation Date:** `2025-09-07T20:00:00Z`
