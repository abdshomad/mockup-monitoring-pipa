### UI/UX & Visualization Enhancements

1.  **`NE-004` Interactive "Time Machine" Playback**
    -   **Idea:** On the Map View, add a timeline scrubber. Operators could drag it back and forth to see a replay of how sensor statuses and alerts evolved over a specific period.
    -   **Benefit:** A powerful tool for post-incident analysis and pattern recognition. It would allow operators to visually understand how an event cascaded through the system.

2.  **`NE-005` Augmented Reality (AR) for Field Technicians**
    -   **Idea:** Create a companion mobile app. When a technician is on-site, they could point their device's camera at a sensor installation, and an AR overlay would display its real-time data, health score, recent alerts, and maintenance history.
    -   **Benefit:** Improves technician efficiency and safety by providing hands-free, contextual information directly in their field of view. Reduces the need to cross-reference with a separate tablet or manual.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
    -   **Priority:** `Very Low`

3.  **`NE-006` Customizable Dashboard Widgets**
    -   **Idea:** Allow operators to customize their dashboard view by adding, removing, and rearranging widgets. For example, an operator focused on the Green Line could have a dashboard showing only stats and charts relevant to that segment.
    -   **Benefit:** Increases user efficiency by tailoring the interface to specific roles and responsibilities. Reduces information overload and allows users to focus on what matters most to them.
