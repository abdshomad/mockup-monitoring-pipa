### AI-Powered Intelligence (Leveraging Gemini)

1.  **`NE-001` Conversational AI Assistant**
    -   **Idea:** Integrate a chat-style assistant directly into the UI. Operators could ask natural language questions like, *"What's the pressure trend for the Red Line over the last 48 hours?"* or *"Summarize all maintenance tasks scheduled for next week."*
    -   **Benefit:** Dramatically speeds up data retrieval and system interaction, reducing the need to navigate through multiple screens and filters. It makes the system more accessible to less experienced operators.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented (2025-09-06T10:00:00Z)`

2.  **`NE-002` Automated Incident Reporting**
    -   **Idea:** After an alert is moved to the "Resolved" stage, use Gemini to automatically generate a draft of the incident report. It would synthesize the alert type, severity, the full action timeline, and the final resolution notes into a structured document.
    -   **Benefit:** Saves significant administrative time for operators, ensures reporting consistency, and reduces the chance of human error in documentation.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented (2025-09-06T10:00:00Z)`

3.  **`NE-003` Multi-Modal Alert Analysis**
    -   **Idea:** Allow field technicians to upload images (e.g., a photo of a damaged section) or short audio clips (e.g., the sound of a leak) directly to an alert. Gemini could then analyze this visual or audio data in conjunction with the sensor readings to provide a richer, more accurate assessment of the situation.
    -   **Benefit:** Provides crucial on-the-ground context to the control room, leading to more informed decisions. For example, the AI could differentiate between the sound of wind and a gas leak, or identify the severity of corrosion from a photo.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented (2025-09-06T14:30:00Z)`

### UI/UX & Visualization Enhancements

4.  **`NE-004` Interactive "Time Machine" Playback**
    -   **Idea:** On the Map View, add a timeline scrubber. Operators could drag it back and forth to see a replay of how sensor statuses and alerts evolved over a specific period.
    -   **Benefit:** A powerful tool for post-incident analysis and pattern recognition. It would allow operators to visually understand how an event cascaded through the system.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented (2025-09-06T15:00:00Z)`

5.  **`NE-005` Augmented Reality (AR) for Field Technicians**
    -   **Idea:** Create a companion mobile app. When a technician is on-site, they could point their device's camera at a sensor installation, and an AR overlay would display its real-time data, health score, recent alerts, and maintenance history.
    -   **Benefit:** Improves technician efficiency and safety by providing hands-free, contextual information directly in their field of view. Reduces the need to cross-reference with a separate tablet or manual.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
    -   **Priority:** `Very Low`

6.  **`NE-006` Customizable Dashboard Widgets**
    -   **Idea:** Allow operators to customize their dashboard view by adding, removing, and rearranging widgets. For example, an operator focused on the Green Line could have a dashboard showing only stats and charts relevant to that segment.
    -   **Benefit:** Increases user efficiency by tailoring the interface to specific roles and responsibilities. Reduces information overload and allows users to focus on what matters most to them.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
    -   **Priority:** `Very Low`

### Operational Workflow Enhancements

7.  **`NE-007` Comprehensive Incident Management Log**
    -   **Idea:** Create a dedicated "Incidents" view where operators can formally log and manage major incidents. An incident could be initiated from a critical alert (or a cluster of related alerts) and would serve as the central record for the entire event lifecycle. Features would include assigning incident commanders, logging actions and communications, attaching reports (like the AI-generated ones), and tracking the incident through to post-mortem analysis.
    -   **Benefit:** Moves beyond simple alert tracking to a more structured incident response framework (like ICS). It provides a single source of truth for major events, improving accountability, post-incident review, and regulatory compliance.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`

8.  **`NE-008` Sensor Installation & Lifecycle Management**
    -   **Idea:** Develop a dedicated module to track the end-to-end lifecycle of sensor installation. This would bridge the gap between the 'Pre-Construction'/'Construction' phases and the 'Operations' phase. It would allow project managers to track the status of each sensor deployment (e.g., 'Awaiting Installation', 'Installed, Pending QA', 'Active'), log installation details (technician, date, notes), and link directly to the corresponding asset in the 'Asset Management' inventory from the moment of deployment.
    -   **Benefit:** Provides granular visibility into the implementation progress, improves accountability for field teams, and creates a comprehensive historical record for each asset from its very inception, which is invaluable for long-term maintenance and troubleshooting.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`

9.  **`NE-009` Detailed Sensor Asset Profiling**
    -   **Idea:** Enhance the 'Asset Management' module to create a comprehensive profile for each sensor. This would go beyond the current data to include fields for: a photo of the installed unit, detailed technical specifications (e.g., operating temperature, accuracy), manufacturer part number, the technician who performed the installation, and a log for firmware versions. It could also link to calibration certificates and maintenance logs.
    -   **Benefit:** Creates a definitive "digital passport" for every physical asset in the field. This simplifies maintenance, warranty claims, and troubleshooting by consolidating all relevant information into a single, easily accessible view. It provides a complete chain of custody and history for each device.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
