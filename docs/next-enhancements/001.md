### AI-Powered Intelligence (Leveraging Gemini)

1.  **`NE-001` Conversational AI Assistant**
    -   **Idea:** Integrate a chat-style assistant directly into the UI. Operators could ask natural language questions like, *"What's the pressure trend for the Red Line over the last 48 hours?"* or *"Summarize all maintenance tasks scheduled for next week."*
    -   **Benefit:** Dramatically speeds up data retrieval and system interaction, reducing the need to navigate through multiple screens and filters. It makes the system more accessible to less experienced operators.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented (2025-09-06T10:00:00Z)`

2.  **`NE-002` Automated Incident Reporting**
    -   **Idea:** After an alert is moved to the "Resolved" stage, use Gemini to automatically generate a draft of the incident report. It would synthesize the alert type, severity, the full action timeline, and the final resolution notes into a structured document.
    -   **Benefit:** Saves significant administrative time for operators, ensures reporting consistency, and reduces the chance of human error in documentation.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented (2025-09-06T10:00:00Z)`

3.  **`NE-003` Multi-Modal Alert Analysis**
    -   **Idea:** Allow field technicians to upload images (e.g., a photo of a damaged section) or short audio clips (e.g., the sound of a leak) directly to an alert. Gemini could then analyze this visual or audio data in conjunction with the sensor readings to provide a richer, more accurate assessment of the situation.
    -   **Benefit:** Provides crucial on-the-ground context to the control room, leading to more informed decisions. For example, the AI could differentiate between the sound of wind and a gas leak, or identify the severity of corrosion from a photo.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented (2025-09-06T14:30:00Z)`

### UI/UX & Visualization Enhancements

4.  **`NE-004` Interactive "Time Machine" Playback**
    -   **Idea:** On the Map View, add a timeline scrubber. Operators could drag it back and forth to see a replay of how sensor statuses and alerts evolved over a specific period.
    -   **Benefit:** A powerful tool for post-incident analysis and pattern recognition. It would allow operators to visually understand how an event cascaded through the system.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`

5.  **`NE-005` Augmented Reality (AR) for Field Technicians**
    -   **Idea:** Create a companion mobile app. When a technician is on-site, they could point their device's camera at a sensor installation, and an AR overlay would display its real-time data, health score, recent alerts, and maintenance history.
    -   **Benefit:** Improves technician efficiency and safety by providing hands-free, contextual information directly in their field of view. Reduces the need to cross-reference with a separate tablet or manual.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`

6.  **`NE-006` Customizable Dashboard Widgets**
    -   **Idea:** Allow operators to customize their dashboard view by adding, removing, and rearranging widgets. For example, an operator focused on the Green Line could have a dashboard showing only stats and charts relevant to that segment.
    -   **Benefit:** Increases user efficiency by tailoring the interface to specific roles and responsibilities. Reduces information overload and allows users to focus on what matters most to them.
    -   **Status:** `Idea`
